# About project 
N-puzzle is a popular puzzle game that consists of N tiles where N can have
different values such as 8, 15, 24 and so on. The puzzle is divided into √
N + 1
rows and √
N + 1 columns. It consists of one empty space where the tiles can be
moved and thus the puzzle is solved when a particular goal pattern is formed.
There are several algorithms developed for N-puzzle problems which can be
categorized as Uninformed Search Algorithms and Informed Search Algorithms.
Uninformed Search Algorithms include <br/>
• Breadth-first Search <br/>
• Depth-first Search<br/>
• Iterative Deepening Search<br/>
some of which, we are familiar from tree algorithms. Informed Search Algorihms
include<br/>
• A* Search<br/>
• Greedy Search<br/>
To solve this problem, we will be using A* Search algorithm, which is a general
artificial intelligence methodology to solve similar problems. Informed Search
Algorithms, as the name suggest, must be informed about the current state by
some parameter, which is called the heuristic. A heuristic, also called heuristic function, is a function that ranks alternatives in search algorithms at each
branching step.
